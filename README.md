A Rails project I built as a bootcamp student at [Tealeaf Academy](https://gotealeaf.com) (which has rebranded as [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/)).

It was built around the idea of discovering comics and discussing them in a forum. It was also to practice TDD/BDD which was a heavy focus in the curriculum.

Built with Ruby 2.1 and Rails 4.1 and tested with RSpec.

##Features:
- Comic discussion and discovery forum
- User registration + authentication
- Simple User profiles with contribution information
- Reading list for users to save comics they like for reference later. List can be organized by position number.
- Case insensitive comic search
